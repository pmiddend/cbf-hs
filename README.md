# cbf - Crystallographic Binary Format in Haskell

This library can read so-called cbf files, described [here](https://www.iucr.org/__data/iucr/cif/software/cbflib/CBFlib_0.7.9/doc/CBFlib.html). It can currently only read a tiny subset of CBF files, namely those that are spit out by Dectris' Pilatus detectors. More to come though. The project aims to be fully Haskell, no C code or bindings.
